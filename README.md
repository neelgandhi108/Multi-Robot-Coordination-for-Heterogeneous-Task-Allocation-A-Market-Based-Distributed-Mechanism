# Multi-Robot-Coordination-for-Heterogeneous-Task-Allocation-A-Market-Based-Distributed-Mechanism

## Abstract:

This project proposes a game-theoretic formulation of the heterogeneous task allocation problem in multi-robot systems, aiming to align the objectives of individual robots with the overall system objective. We introduce a market-based mechanism, which allows robots to exchange messages with tasks and move between task groups to achieve near-optimal system utility in significantly shorter computation times compared to existing mechanisms. The mechanism is flexible, efficient, and possesses anytime and monotonically.

## Introduction:

The project addresses the challenge of task allocation in multi-robot systems and presents a game-theoretic formulation of the problem. Allocating tasks to robots in a way that optimizes the overall system performance is challenging. Our proposed solution aims to align the objectives of individual robots with the overall system objective.

## Related Work:

We discuss existing mechanisms for task allocation in multi-robot systems, such as the distributed strategy adjustment (DSA) and branch-and-bound with fast matching speed (BnB-FMS) mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are limited in their scalability and computation time.

## Proposed Methodology:

Our proposed mechanism, Multi-Robot Coordination for Heterogeneous Task Allocation (MRCHTA), is a market-based distributed mechanism that allows robots to exchange messages with tasks and move between task groups. The mechanism aims to achieve a Nash equilibrium, where no single robot can make a better marginal contribution by joining another task group. The mechanism is scalable, efficient, and possesses anytime and monotonically.

## Experimental Results:

We present empirical studies that compare the performance of MRCHTA with that of DSA and BnB-FMS. The results show that MRCHTA achieves near-optimal system utility in significantly shorter computation times when compared to the other mechanisms. MRCHTA experiences minimum growth in the number of rounds required to reach an equilibrium allocation solution, while DSA requires many more rounds before an equilibrium is reached. MRCHTA requires significantly shorter running time than that required by either BnB-FMS or DSA.

## Conclusion:

The proposed market-based distributed mechanism MRCHTA addresses the challenge of task allocation in multi-robot systems. The mechanism aligns the objectives of individual robots with the overall system objective and achieves near-optimal system utility in significantly shorter computation times compared to existing mechanisms. The mechanism is scalable and possesses anytime and monotonically, making it a promising solution for large-scale task allocation problems in multi-robot systems. We believe that this project can contribute to the advancement of multi-robot coordination and lead to the development of more efficient and effective systems.
